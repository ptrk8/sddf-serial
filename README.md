# seL4 Device Driver Framework (sDDF) UART Driver for the iMX8MM System on Module (SoM).

## Context

* This repo contains a simple seL4 UART device driver for the iMX8MM SoM.
* This driver was used as a familiarisation exercise to prepare me for the development of a block device driver using the sDDF.
